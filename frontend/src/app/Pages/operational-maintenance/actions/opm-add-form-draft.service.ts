/**
 * Keeps the in-progress "Add Defect / DART" form alive across `OpmActionsComponent`
 * being destroyed and recreated — switching to another Operational Maintenance tab
 * and back, or browser back/forward, both tear the component down. A plain
 * root-provided singleton survives that; the component's own signals don't. Cleared
 * explicitly on "Back to List" or a successful submit — it's a draft, not a
 * permanent store, so it only outlives one navigation. Mirrors
 * `SfdAddFormDraftService` in the sibling `sfd/management` module.
